# Resolving-Conflicts-in-Heterogeneous-Data--CRH_Framework
Resolving Conflicts in Heterogeneous Data by Truth Discovery and Source Reliability Estimation
The implementation of "Resolving Conflicts in Heterogeneous Data by Truth
Discovery and Source Reliability Estimation" - by Qi Li1, Yaliang Li1, Jing Gao1,et. all in PYTHON is given in the notebook file

# IMPORTANT:
1)The coressponding paper of the implementation is cited in the folder 
2)The Dataset is uploaded as two text files , weather_ground_truth & weather_data_set 
3)The results of implementation in Python=3.7 is snipped and attached as  "CRH_RESULTS.png" 

# NOTE:
1) ingnore a error in ln[69] , proceed to execute rest of the cells
2) the weight results are calculated using numerical data by applying the given algorithm in the paper
